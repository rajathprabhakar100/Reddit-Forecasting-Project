1. Download files off of Box
2. combine_reddit().R
3. process_reddit_files().R
4. ccf_city_case_files().R

## To Do
* create data frame with cases and deaths combined, also add city that corresponds to MSA Code
* graphs of all variables by average correlations, average lag, average rank, with each filtered by positive and negative lag
* for the top 12 variables by average correlation for positive lags, provide a scatter plot that has the lag on the x axis and max correlation  on the y axis with a point for each city
* for the health and illness variables, plot the covid-19 case count time series alongside the time-series of the variable on the same plot. 18 time-series plots for each one
